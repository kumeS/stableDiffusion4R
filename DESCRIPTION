Description: AArtificial Intelligence (AI)-based image generation techniques are revolutionizing various fields, 
    and this package brings those capabilities into the R environment. This package provides a seamless interface to integrate the 'Stable Diffusion' Web APIs 
    (see <https://platform.stability.ai/docs/getting-started>) into R, allowing users to leverage advanced image transformation methods. 
    Specifically, this package includes functions for text-to-image (txt2img or t2i) and image-to-image (img2img or i2i) transformations 
    using the 'Stable Diffusion' APIs, enabling creative and analytical applications in data visualization and more.
Depends: R (>= 4.2.0)
